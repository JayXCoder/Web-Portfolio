                    <p class="card-text">
                        I'm a Computer Engineer graduate from University Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP) with Bachelor Honours in Computer Engineering 
                        and a completely self-taught computer science programmer. My journey into programming started with curiosity and determination 
                        to learn everything from scratch through YouTube tutorials, internet guides, and hands-on experimentation.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        What sets me apart is my entrepreneurial spirit - I've been turning my final year projects 
                        into side business ventures, learning not just to code, but to build real-world solutions 
                        that solve actual problems. This practical approach has made me a versatile developer 
                        across multiple domains.
